\section*{Introduction} 
What is Big data?\\
Big Data is a term used for addressing a huge and heterogeneous amount of data too large to be handled with common software systems. The information contained by this data set can be classified into various groups and many dimensions. Such versatile databases are fragile enough and immense in volume requiring a powerful and dynamic management system including software, infrastructure to meet todayâ€™s demand and privacy and security concerns. Besides these, management should be powerful enough to make it available in real time, which will allow it to be analysed and used immediately.
